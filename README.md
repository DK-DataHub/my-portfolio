# My Portfolio

This portfolio website showcases my skills, projects, and experience.  
It is **based on an open-source template** created by [Original Author’s Name or GitHub link].  
I have customized it with my own content, including:
- My skills and tools
- My personal projects
- My internships and experience
- My contact details

All content (skills, projects, and experience) reflects my own work.  
The design and structure are adapted from the original template.
